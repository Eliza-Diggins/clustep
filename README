===============================================================

Required libraries (and the names of the packages in Ubuntu):

NumPy (python-numpy)
Cython (cython)
python-dev
Matplotlib (python-matplotlib)

===============================================================

Installation:

All the scripts can be executed without installation or compilation,
except for cluster.py, which uses a custom Cython library that has to
be compiled. For that, just cd to /cluster and type 'make'. A new file,
named rejection.so, will be created, and then cluster.py will be ready
for execution.

===============================================================

Syntax:

* To create an initial conditions galaxy cluster halo snapshot with
  cluster.py, contaning both dark matter and gas:
    cd cluster/
    python cluster.py --gas [FILE]

* To do the same, but with dark matter only (no gas):
    cd cluster/
    python cluster.py --dm [FILE]

* To create density and average squared radial velocity distributions
  plots for a given snapshot (the output will be the creation of two
  images in the file's folder):
    python profiles.py [FILE]
