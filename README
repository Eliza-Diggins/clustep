===============================================================

Required libraries (and the name of the packages in Ubuntu):

NumPy (python-numpy)
Cython (cython)
Matplotlib (python-matplotlib)

===============================================================

Installation:

All the scripts can be executed without installation or compilation, except for
cluster.py, which uses a custom Cython library that has to be compiled. For
that, just cd to /cluster and type 'make'. A new file, named rejection.so, will
be created, and then cluster.py will be ready for execution.
